# FuzzyTableLookUpAlgorithem
Design of Fuzzy System Using Table Look Up Scheme Algorithm
- Prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series.
- Development of no conflict rule base and customization of the project for any membership function.
fuzzy system, and inference engine types.
- The algorithm implements in MATLAB using Fozzy Logic Toolbox.

This program was developed as a course project for Fuzzy systems course by Habibollah Naeimi.


### MFDetector.m
A Function for Finding The Membership Function Value and The Membership Function Number of each Data.

### RuleFinder.m
It finds rule's number and it's membership value. 

### ConflictChecking.m
This function finds and deletes conflicts in rule base.
